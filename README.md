# Synthetic Fine-Tuning for Multilingual Biomedical Named Entity Recognition

This repository implements a synthetic-data generation and training pipeline for biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) in English, Spanish, German, and French. It addresses a central problem in BioNER: strong supervised models normally require large, expensive, expert-annotated datasets.

The pipeline samples disease terms from biomedical terminologies and uses a decoder language model to generate and annotate synthetic text. The synthetic examples are used to pretrain a smaller BERT-based BioNER model with a bidirectional recurrent layer, multi-head attention (MHA), and a conditional random field (CRF). The model is then fine-tuned on 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, or 100% of a gold-labelled downstream dataset.

TODO: The paper associated with this code [`paper`](https://TBD) TBD.
TODO: Synthetic data available at: [`data`](https://TBD) TBD.

## Main results
TODO: plots and images 
> **TODO — main-results figure:** Add the paper figure containing the complete F1 results, including the 20%, 50%, and 100% gold-data settings.

## Method overview

1. Download the gold corpora and biomedical terminology resources.
2. Convert each corpus to the repository's sentence-level JSON format and create the 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50% training subsets.
3. Sample disease terms from SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and the Disease Ontology.
4. Generate zero-shot or three-shot synthetic sentences with a decoder language model served by llama.cpp. 
5. Ask the language model to check or correct the entity annotations and apply language-specific spaCy processing.
6. Pretrain the BioNER model on the corrected synthetic data.
7. Fine-tune the model on a selected percentage of gold data.
8. Evaluate the model on the unchanged gold test set.

> **TODO — pipeline figure:** Add the methodology figure from the paper here.

Experiment directories contain three configuration families:

- `baseline/*.yml`: train only on a gold-data subset.
- `0shot/pretrain.yml` and `0shot/ft_*.yml`: pretrain on zero-shot synthetic data, then fine-tune on gold data.
- `3shot_<percentage>/pretrain.yml` and `3shot_<percentage>/ft_*.yml`: pretrain on three-shot synthetic data generated using examples from the indicated percentage of the gold training set, then fine-tune on gold data.

## Requirements

The supplied research workflow targets a Linux server or HPC cluster. NVIDIA CUDA GPU recommended for training; generation scripts request two GPUs a CUDA llama.cpp server image, using GGUF model weights.

### Language models and encoders

The experiments expect local copies of the following encoder families beneath `EMBEDDINGS_PATH`:

| Experiment name | Expected local directory |
|---|---|
| `bioBERT` | `bioBERT_setup/` |
| `roBERTa_clinical_es` | `roBERTa_clinical_es_setup/` |
| `drBERT_fr` | `drBERT_fr_setup/` |
| `medBERT_ger` | `medBERT_ger_setup/` |


The preprocessing and generation configurations additionally use these spaCy pipelines:
```text
en_core_web_trf, es_dep_news_trf, de_dep_news_trf, fr_dep_news_trf
```

## Installation and environment setup

Clone the paper branch and enter the repository:
TODO:
```bash
git clone --branch paper https://github.com/VidasMarta/bioNER.git
cd bioNER
```

Create a Python environment and install the current dependency list:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r start-bioner-docker/requirements_base.txt
```

Install the language-specific spaCy pipelines. English can be installed directly with spaCy; the exact installation sources for the other transformer pipelines still need to be documented.

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf

# TODO: install es_dep_news_trf
# TODO: install de_dep_news_trf
# TODO: install fr_dep_news_trf
```

Create the local settings file:

```bash
cp settings.template.py settings.py
```

Edit `settings.py` and configure all paths:

```python
MODEL_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/model-checkpoints"
DATA_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/processed-data"
OUTPUT_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/output"
EXPERIMENTS_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/bioNER/experiments"
LOG_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/logs"
EMBEDDINGS_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/local-transformer-models"
```

Create the model and log directories before training. `settings.py` is ignored by Git so machine-specific paths are not committed.

### Container setup

The intended image is based on:

```text
pytorch/pytorch:2.4.1-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime
```

The current Docker recipe is a development snapshot and is **not yet directly buildable**: its build-context assumptions must be corrected and the referenced `test_imports.py` file is absent.

The intended build interface is:

```bash
# TODO: this command must be validated after repairing the Dockerfile.
docker build -t syn-bioner -f start-bioner-docker/Dockerfile .
```

TODO:

- Repair and test the Dockerfile.
- Add `test_imports.py`.
- Install all four required spaCy pipelines.
- Document `docker run` with NVIDIA GPU support.
- Document the required data, model, output, and log volume mounts.

## Data

Gold corpora and terminology resources are not tracked in Git. Obtain each resource from its provider and comply with its individual terms.

| Language | Corpus | Source | Access notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| English | NCBI Disease | [NCBI Disease Corpus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/) | Public download; verify the corpus terms before redistribution |
| Spanish | DisTEMIST | [Zenodo record 7614764](https://zenodo.org/records/7614764) | Public record; retain the accompanying license and citation |
| German | BRONCO150 | [BRONCO project page](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~leser/bronco/index.html) | Not bundled; request access and sign the required data-use agreement |
| French | QUAERO | [DrBenchmark/QUAERO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DrBenchmark/QUAERO) | Check the licenses of the EMEA and MEDLINE source material |

Synthetic prompts sample disease terminology from:

- SNOMED CT;
- language-specific ICD-10 resources; and
- the Disease Ontology snapshot obtained in August 2025.

These resources may have different access and redistribution conditions. In particular, do not redistribute restricted terminology or BRONCO150 content as part of a synthetic-data release without checking the governing agreements.

TODO: add the exact terminology releases, download URLs, checksums, license notes, and preprocessing commands.

### Expected data layout

The checked-in YAML files currently contain machine-specific absolute paths. After adapting them to the local machine, the intended layout is approximately:

```text
syn-bioner/
├── bioNER/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   │   ├── MeSH_NCBI/
│   │   ├── distemist/
│   │   ├── BRONCO150/
│   │   └── quaero/
│   ├── KB/
│   │   ├── SNOMEDCT/
│   │   ├── ICD10_GE_CH/
│   │   ├── ICD10FR/
│   │   └── hetionet/
│   ├── processed/
│   │   ├── ncbi/trf/
│   │   ├── distemist/trf/
│   │   ├── bronco150/trf/
│   │   └── quaero/trf/
│   └── synthetic/
│       ├── ncbi/

│       ├── bronco150/
│       └── quaero/
├── models/
├── output/
└── logs/
```

## Reproducing the experiments

The commands below describe the shortest path through the current code. They are templates: review all YAML paths and shell variables before submitting a long-running job.

### 1. Preprocess a gold corpus

From the directory containing the `bioNER` package, run a corpus converter. For example, for NCBI Disease:

```bash
python3 -m bioNER.data_wranglig.ncbi_to_json \
  --config_file bioNER/experiments/data/ncbi.yml
```

Equivalent modules exist for the other corpora:

```bash
python3 -m bioNER.data_wranglig.distemist_to_json \
  --config_file bioNER/experiments/data/distemist.yml

python3 -m bioNER.data_wranglig.quaero_to_json \
  --config_file bioNER/experiments/data/quaero.yml

python3 -m bioNER.data_wranglig.bronco150_to_json \
  --config_file bioNER/experiments/data/bronco150.yml
```

On SLURM, edit `USERNAME`, `CORPORA`, `SPACY_MODELS`, and the container paths in `experiments/preprocess.sh`, then submit it:

```bash
sbatch bioNER/experiments/preprocess.sh
```

The converters create train, development, and test JSON files and percentage-based training subsets in the configured `parsed_mesh_folder`.

### 2. Generate synthetic data

The supplied generation scripts start a local llama.cpp server and invoke the generation client in an Apptainer/Singularity image.

Before submission, configure:

- `USERNAME`;
- `CORPUS` (`ncbi`, `distemist`, `quaero`, or `bronco150`);
- the GGUF `MODEL` and model directory;
- server and client container paths;
- scratch paths;
- batch size and port;
- zero-shot or three-shot settings; and
- annotation-checking settings.

Submit the appropriate model-size template:

```bash
sbatch bioNER/experiments/generate_kshot4B.sh
```

or:

```bash
sbatch bioNER/experiments/generate_kshot27B.sh
```

For a manually managed llama.cpp server, the Python client can be invoked directly from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m bioNER.kshot_synthetic_generation \
  --config_file bioNER/experiments/ncbi/0shot_generation.yml
```

The configuration's `server_url` must expose a llama.cpp-compatible `POST /completion` endpoint.

A generation directory contains:

```text
generated_sentences_YYYYMMDD.jsonl            # Raw model text
corrected_generated_sentences_YYYYMMDD.jsonl  # Corrected annotations
term_list.txt                                 # Sampled terminology entries
timings.json                                  # Per-batch timings
generation.log                                # Generation diagnostics
```

### 3. Train a gold-only baseline

Training imports `settings.py` and should be launched from the `bioNER` directory:

```bash
cd bioNER

python train.py \
  --config experiments/ncbi/baseline/1pct.yml \
  --model_name NCBI_baseline_1pct
```

Each invocation trains and evaluates five seeded runs. Configurations for the other languages are located under their respective experiment directories.

### 4. Pretrain on synthetic data

The synthetic file named in the selected `pretrain.yml` must exist beneath `DATA_PATH`.

For example:

```bash
python train.py \
  --config experiments/ncbi/0shot/pretrain.yml \
  --model_name 27B_NCBI_0shot
```

The model name matters: downstream configurations use `pretrained_weights_path` to locate checkpoints with the following pattern:

```text
<model-name>_seed<seed>_best.bin
```

### 5. Fine-tune on gold data

After synthetic pretraining, fine-tune the model on the chosen gold percentage:

```bash
python train.py \
  --config experiments/ncbi/0shot/ft_1pct.yml \
  --model_name 27B_NCBI_0shot_ft_1pct
```

Repeat with the corresponding:

```text
ft_5pct.yml
ft_10pct.yml
ft_20pct.yml
ft_50pct.yml
ft_100pct.yml
```

Repeat the baseline, pretraining, and fine-tuning grid for all four corpora and for the zero-shot and three-shot synthetic conditions.

> **Known configuration gap:** The tracked NCBI `baseline/` directory currently contains only `1pct.yml` and `5pct.yml`. TODO: add the 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100% NCBI baseline configurations needed for the complete paper grid.

## Runtime and computational cost

A full reproduction is expected to take approximately **seven days on a server with two NVIDIA A100 GPUs**, although runtime depends strongly on generator size, GPU memory, llama.cpp build, batch size, storage performance, and queue time.

The included generation SLURM templates request:

- two GPUs;
- 24 GB system memory;
- eight CPU cores; and
- up to approximately five days for one submitted job.

Training runs each configuration five times.

TODO: report measured generation and training time, peak GPU memory, energy usage, and storage requirements for every model and corpus.

## Reproducibility and expected variation

Training uses the following seeds:

```text
42
198
6000
3828
7382
```

Synthetic generation uses seed `42`.

PyTorch deterministic cuDNN behavior is requested during training, but exact equality is not guaranteed across:

- GPU models;
- CUDA and cuDNN versions;
- PyTorch versions;
- tokenizer and model revisions;
- spaCy pipeline versions; or
- llama.cpp builds.

Other known limitations include:

- Requirements and model revisions are not pinned.
- Configuration files contain local absolute paths and dated synthetic filenames.
- Generation relies on external model weights and a separately built llama.cpp server container.
- Multilingual spaCy pipelines are not fully installed by the current Dockerfile.
- BRONCO150 requires approval and a data-use agreement.
- Preprocessing and annotation policies differ between the four corpora.
- LLM generation and GPU kernels can introduce numerical or textual variation.
- The Docker recipe and end-to-end commands have not yet been validated on a clean machine.
- Some experiment configurations use `bronco`, while others use `bronco150`; normalize these paths before running the German experiments.
- Different GPU hardware may change generation throughput, supported batch sizes, and generated output.

## License and reuse

**Software license:** TODO: choose a license and add a root `LICENSE` file. Until then, the repository does not state permission to copy, modify, or redistribute the software.

**Synthetic-data license:** TODO: add the selected open-data license to the data archive and clarify which source-data or terminology restrictions carry over.

Gold corpora, pretrained models, spaCy pipelines, biomedical terminologies, and container base images retain their own licenses and access conditions.

## Citation

TODO: add `CITATION.cff` after the paper metadata is final.

In the meantime, replace the placeholders below with the published citation:

```bibtex
@article{TODO,
  title   = {TODO: Paper title},
  author  = {TODO: Authors},
  journal = {TODO: Venue},
  year    = {TODO: Year},
  doi     = {TODO: DOI},
  url     = {TODO: Publication URL}
}
```

When using an individual gold corpus, terminology, language model, or pretrained encoder, cite that resource separately according to its provider's instructions.
