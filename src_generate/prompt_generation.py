            2. When annotating, if the text contains: "the patient feels pain in the fingers last ..." do not annotate it is not a disease or diagnosis.
                "Cystic fibrosis is a disease that ..." annotate as ["cystic fibrosis",] Modified entities and terms are annotated and transcribed exactly as they appear in the text; their form is not changed or reduced to the infinitive.
